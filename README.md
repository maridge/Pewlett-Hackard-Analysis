# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The puroise of the project was to determine the number of retiring employees from Pewlett-Hackard as well as identify the number of employees whom would be eligible for a mentorship program to help train new employees that are going to be needed to replace the retiring employees.  We identified which employees will be retireing by date of birth between 01/01/1952 and 12/31/1955.  From the employee data of Pewlett-Hackard we were able to determine which employees that are going to retire, the position they currently hold, and the departments that will be effected by the retirements.

## Results:
-  Reviewing the retirement titles table we can see how long eligible retirees have worked at each position over the course of their caereer.
  
-  The unique titles table indicates the current title for employees that are eligible for retirement.
  
- The retiring titles table indicates that the majority of the retirees hold senior titles within the company

- The mentorship program table indicates that there are only 1,940 eligible employees that would be able to cross train to replace some of the retirees

## Summary:

In summary, there are a lot more employees that are going to be retiring then are eligible for the mentorship program.  There can be some additional analysis completed to determine who could be ready for the mentorship program relatively quickly.  There can also be additional analysis based on age to determine which departments will be effected more then others and shift prioritites for the mentorship program to those departments first.
